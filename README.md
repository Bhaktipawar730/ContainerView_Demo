# ContainerView_Demo

**ContainerViewApp** is an iOS app built with Swift and UIKit, demonstrating efficient management of multiple child view controllers within container views. The app dynamically switches between different views based on user interaction with a segmented control, offering a fluid and responsive interface.

## Features

- **Container View Management:** Easily add and display child view controllers within container views.  
- **Dynamic View Switching:** Seamlessly toggle between views using a segmented control to control the displayed child view controller.  
- **Interactive User Interface:** Provide an engaging user experience by dynamically adjusting the UI based on user input.  

## How it Works 

The app uses two container views to hold two child view controllers. The segmented control allows users to switch between the views of these child controllers.  

- When a segment is selected, the corresponding view is displayed, while the other view is hidden.  
- The background color also changes based on the selected segment to show the change clearly.
